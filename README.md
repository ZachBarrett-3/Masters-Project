# Predicting Endotracheal Intubation using Deep Learning

The code in this repository accompanies my research paper which is linked `Barrett_Final_Draft.pdf`. The primary objective with this repository is to provide transparency and reproducibility for the results presented in this paper. By sharing this code, I hope to encourage further research into the field of predictive medicine for ICU patients with pneumonia. 

## Code

### Pre-processing

Step 1: Obtain access to the MIMIC-III Clinical Database

You will need to complete a training regarding data security and sharing of the medical information in the database. Once you are credentialed, then you will be able to request access to the database. You can learn more about the database and the credentialing process here:
